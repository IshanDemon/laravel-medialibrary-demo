# Introduction

To get you started we've prepared a couple of basic real-life examples showing off the capabilities of the medialibrary.
 They're available in this seperate Laravel project: [https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary-demo]().

To get started with this demo project follow the instructions in the repo's [README](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary-demo/blob/master/README.md). You'll have to set up a database with some migrations and seed it with the demo data.

All examples are available as commands in the `app/Console/Commands` directory. We've also prepared some models for you in the `app` directory.

Finally, in the `demofiles` directory you'll find some demo files which you can use in the example commands.
