# Introduction

Great, you've made it this far.

To get you started with the Medialibrary we've prepared a couple of basic, real-life demo's showing off the capabilities of the package. Every demo has a small explanation of what's going on as well.

You can find all code for these demo's in the `app` directory. Finally, in the `demofiles` directory you'll find some demo files which you can use in demo's.
